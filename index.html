            <h1>Let's talk about soup!</h1>
            <p>There's something about soup that is incredibly comforting. The idea of throwing a myriad of ingredients into a big pot of stock and letting it do its own thing is absolutely magical. It can be something as simple as some vegetables simmered in broth or something more complex and time-consuming that leaves you with a bubbling cauldron of rich flavor. It is cooking at its simplest and yet it can be so refined.</p>
            <p>Usually considered a wintertime staple, many cultures around the world favor soup even in the summertime. This is where soup's flexability shines, allowing us to enjoy a rich, hearty soup in the wintertime or a light, refreshing soup during the warmer months.</p>
            <p>Here are just a few of my favorite soup recipes that can be enjoyed at any time during the year. </p>

                    <li>Place a large sauce pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil and chopped onions. Saute for 3 minutes to soften. Then add the chopped bell pepper, carrots, and garlic. Saute another 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add whole raw chicken breasts, chicken broth, dried thyme, crushed red pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper to the pot. Bring to a simmer. Lower the heat a little and simmer 15 minutes, until the chicken in cooked through. Remove the chicken and place on a cutting board.</li>
                    <li>Turn the heat back to medium. With the broth still simmering, stir in the DeLallo Three Cheese Tortellini. Stir well so it doesn't stick together. Then chop or shred the chicken and place back in the soup.</li>
                    <li>Once the tortellini is cooked through, about 10-14 minutes, turn off the heat. Stir in 1/4 cup heavy cream, spinach, and parsley. Add a little more cream if desired. Taste, then salt and pepper as needed.</li>

                    <li>Set a large 6-8 quart soup pot (or dutch oven) over medium heat. Add the oil and chopped onions. Saute the onions for 2-3 minutes, stirring. Then add in the garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper. Saute another 2-3 minutes to soften.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken broth, whole chicken breasts, and chopped green chiles to the pot. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper. Bring to a boil. Then simmer for 20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
